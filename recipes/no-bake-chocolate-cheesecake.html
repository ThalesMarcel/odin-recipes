  </ul>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>¼ cup salted butter, melted</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar, divided</li>
    <li>140 grams dark chocolate, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>
    <li>2 or 3 tablespoons hot water, or as needed</li>
    <li>225 grams cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter and 1 tablespoon of sugar; press crumb mixture into bottom and 1 centimeter up the sides of an 20 centimeters springform pan. Refrigerate crust while you make the filling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in the microwave on high power for 1 to 2 minutes, or until melted, stirring every 15 seconds; set aside to cool.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whisk cocoa powder and enough warm water together in a medium bowl to form a smooth paste.
    </li>
    <li>
      Beat cream cheese and remaining sugar into cocoa mixture until combined; set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold in cooled melted chocolate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fold chocolate cream mixture into cream cheese mixture until thoroughly combined; spread on top of graham cracker crust.
    </li>
    <li>
      Freeze cheesecake for 1 hour. Thaw in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Taste a little of the filling to ensure that the right amount of chocolaty goodness has been reached. You can add a little more of the cocoa powder and water mixture to taste.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instead of freezing, the cheesecake can also be covered and chilled at least 2 hours before serving.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cheesecake may be stored in an airtight container and chilled up to 5 days.
